Apps for the Bread and Butter Notes Website
===========================================

It seems to me that three apps are suggested for this project::

    notes
    users
    e-mail

The Notes App
-------------

The notes app has the responsibility of managing the notes and responses.

Users need to be able to::

    View all the note summaries in page groups
    View an individual note in it entirety with links to all its responses
    View a response to an individual note
    Create a note
    Edit a note created by that user
    Delete a note that user created
    Create a reponse to a note being viewed
    Edit a response that user has written
    Delete a response that user has written

The Users App
-------------

The users app has the responsibility of managing the users and their user profiles.

Users need to be able to::

    Change their display name and password
    Change the image representing them (future)

The E-mail App
--------------

The e-mail app has the responsibility of managing the e-mails sent by the website.

Administrator needs to be able to::

    Compose an e-mail template to be filled in with the proper information at the time of sending
    Send an e-mail to the whole group
    Send an e-mail to selected members of the group
